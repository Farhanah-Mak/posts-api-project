# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### In this project I tried to fetch posts from an api and displayed it in a three pane layout. When we click on a post it displays the details of that posts and the comments related to that post on the right section. This project helped me to -- 
##### learn the basics of React
##### how props get passed to components
##### how state is managed within components
##### gain knowledge about react hooks like useEffect and useState
